From start to finish, working with him, Jay & their Team was a positive experience! They were always patient, professional and gave us sound advice, on material quality, options, and structure. When the project began, they were thorough and diligent. At each step we were always told their goal is to make us happy and that they are easy to work with. Hard to believe yet, so true! We are very happy with the result. They turned our vision into reality. Our neighbors have been complimenting us too. Weâ€™re glad to have found such a great contractor and grateful that we worked with such nice people, Peter, Jay, and their Team. We highly recommend SA Construction!"

I closed on a new house the first week in March of 2020 knowing I had to replace the roof , siding, gutters etc. We all know what happened a week later! Itâ€™s been EXTREMELY difficult and stressful to find contractors/get anything done. After at least SIX quotes for my job over a period of many months, I finally found SA! Their quote was by far superior in every way: They didnâ€™t give me a 45 minute PowerPoint with a salesperson, they showed up themselves, they had the siding I wanted right away, (which is next to impossible right now), they made it simple! They have experience and knowledge and itâ€™s obvious right from the beginning. They understood what I wanted and gave me a fair price. No BS. ðŸ˜ƒ Finally! All concerns and questions were addressed during and AFTER the job -they arenâ€™t going to disappear on you ! The job was done fast and professionally. They started within a week of the initial quote and it was done about a week later, even w winter weather! My house looks like a different house! Itâ€™s BEAUTIFUL. I couldnâ€™t be happier. THANK YOU SA !"
